# What I'm Learning

Things I want to learn in 2023:

## To learn NOW:

- [ ] How to work with Microservices with DDD, CQRS and Apache Kafka (or RabbitMQ)
- [ ] Become a .NET expert and learn the most important Built-in functions and libraries


## To learn on free time (or hobbie)
- [ ] Some "strange" functional programming language, like OCaml or Haskell and do Compilers with him
- [ ] Front-end development with AngularJS (i need to be a fucking fullstack engineer)
